# polygno_octoprint_flow_monitor

Integrates the Polygno Flow Monitor information into the webpage for Octoprint.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/ed-french/polygno_octoprint_flow_monitor/archive/master.zip

Once installed, you will need to go to settings and put the URL on your local network of the Flow Insights Monitor in. If you can't find this it is always on the small display between prints, or during a print you can find it by pressing the bottom button to the right of the display.
